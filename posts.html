    <h1>Blog</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to my blog! This is still pretty bare for now, but I have lots of ideas for articles. Maybe one day I will actualy write some them. For now you can take a look at the few posts I've written below.
    </p>
    <ul class="post-list">
        {% for post in site.posts %}
          <li>
            {% include post-teaser.html post=post %}
          </li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
</div>
