<p>
	This was a short-term contract job to develop a proof-of-concept exporter for SketchUp. The exporter rendered a view of the current 3D model in a 2D format that could be used in the Renoworks renderer. The plugin was developed in Ruby and C++ using the SketchUp API and also involved the use of a C++ Clipper library for performing binary operations on sets of paths in SVG files.
