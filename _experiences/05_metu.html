    The international exchange program allows a student to spend a number of semesters obtaining credits for their home
    institution in another country. METU is widely considered to be the top university in Turkey, but the experience is
    not only educational. There is much to learn culturally in Turkey and often while travelling to new countries you
    also learn more about yourself.
