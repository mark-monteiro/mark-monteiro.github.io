    Grand Rounds provides subscribers to their program with access to their netwok of top physicians from whom they can schedule an office visit or get a second opinion on a previous diagnosis. This job involved front-end and back-end work on the main company website and several internal tools. The engineering team worked under an agile-based development cycle, with a focus on test-driven development.
