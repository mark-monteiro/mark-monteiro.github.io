<p>
	The Countify product is a stylish sign that can be hung outside a business to track customer check-ins on Foursquare in real-time. It has already seen moderate success with adoption by several businesses in Ankara and even a pre-order from the co-founder of Foursquare.
</p>
<p>
	The website was developed using ASP.net MVC technology and uses a custom-written OAuth2 client (<a href="https://github.com/mark-monteiro/FoursquareOAuth2Client">source</a>) to interact with the Foursquare API for authentication. Once authenticated, the back-end server processes push notification from Foursquare in real-time and sends updates to the Arduino board that runs the counter.

	In the time since this initial development, the product has evolved with Foursquare to use the Swarm logo and has rebranded as Multify.
