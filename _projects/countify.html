	The Countify product is a stylish sign that can be hung outside a business to track customer check-ins on Foursquare in real-time. The website was developed using ASP.net MVC technology and uses a custom-written OAuth2 client (<a href="https://github.com/mark-monteiro/FoursquareOAuth2Client">source</a>) to interact with the Foursquare API for authentication. Once authenticated, the back-end processes push notification from Foursquare to update the counter in real-time. Each customer is provided with a personal dashboard on the website to manage their sign.

	In the time since this initial development, the product has evolved with Foursquare to use the Swarm logo and has rebranded as Multify.
