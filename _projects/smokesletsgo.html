<p>
    This site was made as a joke between a few friends as a tribute to the tv show Trailer Park Boys. Though it is very simple in execution, the development involved getting familiar with a few new technologies.
    The website does a simple search and displays the results using the Google Maps Javascript API. It is hosted using the Amazon EC2 elastic cloud hosting system.
