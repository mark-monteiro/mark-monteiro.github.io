    This application is a web portal for deafblind people and caretakers to apply for intervenor service funding from
    the government of Ontario.

    This project was a special challenge because it was necessary to include as many accessibility features as possible
    so that it could be navigated and used by users with various visual and auditory impairments. Accessibility 
    features include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Server-side rendering so that pages can be accessed quickly and correctly be screen-readers on first load</li>
    <li>
        Usage of <code>aria-*</code> attributes as necessary to support dynamic content on the screen, including page
        navigation, notifications, form validation messages, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        Coordination during page navigation to ensure that all server resources are fetched before the navigation
        completes. This is done to ensure that React is able to render the full page content in a single render cycle so
        that the dynamic content inserted into the page is read correctly by screen readers.
    </li>
    <li>Multiple high-contrast themes as alternatives to the default styling that can be switched to at any time.</li>
    <li>Pop-up dialogs for each section of content with ASL videos, along with captions and transcripts.</li>
    <li>
        Integration with <a href='https://www.texthelp.com/en-gb/products/browsealoud/'>Browsealoud</a> for several
        additional accessibility features, including text-to-speech.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The site was tested extensively using screen readers during development, and also tested successfully by users with
    visual and auditory impairments before launch.
